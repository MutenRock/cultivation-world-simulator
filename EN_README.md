# Cultivation World Simulator

An AI-driven cultivation world simulator that aims to create a truly living, immersive xianxia world.

## Overview

Cultivation World Simulator combines traditional game-rule systems with large language models. By first establishing a complete ruleset for the cultivation world, it creates an autonomous, vibrant, immersive virtual world with emergent stories.

Core idea: **Build a credible rule-based world model first, then plug in AI to bring it to life.**

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend Rendering**: pygame (Web support in the future)
- **Simulation Engine**: custom event-driven simulator
- **World Model**: rule-based deterministic systems
- **AI Integration**: LLM-generated actions, decisions, micro-stories

## Background

I have been a long-time reader of xianxia novels, from classics to modern works. As a game AI practitioner, I believe today’s LLM capabilities are sufficient to support a xianxia-style world simulation.

However, LLM-only NPC decision/dialogue is not enough. A credible rule system must ground the world as the “world model”, and then AI makes it vivid.

I aim to create a pure, joyful, direct, living sense of immersion. Not a mere marketing demo, nor purely academic like “Stanford Town”, but a world that players can actually feel and inhabit.

     key: "your-api-key-here"     # your API key
   ```
   See the LiteLLM docs: [`link`](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)

4. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python -m src.run.run
   ```
